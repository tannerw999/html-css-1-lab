    <p>You may have gotten excited thinking you were going to be learning about the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
    <p>Sadly this website is dedicated to all the tuxedo wearing and clumsy penguins.</p>
    <p>Here are some useless, I mean usefull, facts about penguins. If you are an orca or sealion you will probably find this information useful. Or not.</p>
        <p>A group of penguins in the water is called a raft, but on land they are called a waddle.</p>
        <p>The black and white look of penquins is a clever camouflage called countershading.</p>
        <p>Penquins evolved to fly underwater by having solid bones instead of hollw ones.  This reduces the tendency to float.</p>
        <p>Penguins and polar bears are not together in the wild.  Penguins live south of the equator and polar bears live north of the equator.</p>
        <p>Male penguins gift female penquins with rocks in order to woo them. The females use these rocks to help build nests.</p>
        <p>Penguins are some of the most streamlined animals in the world.</p>
